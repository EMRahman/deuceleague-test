# Simulation: two seasons with Claude agents, 3 October 2026

A full two-season study against `main` at `60bc2f9`, after the four work items
agreed on 2 October. The real Worker ran under `wrangler dev`, with emails
captured locally. A deterministic engine played the matches through the player
HTML forms. Independent Claude persona agents played a volunteer coach and four
players at seven checkpoints. No product source was changed.

Short version:

- **Season 1:** 146 matches, 132 resolved (111 agreed by both sides, 21 decided by
  the coach on the site) and 14 left unplayed at the deadline.
- **Season 2:** 139 matches, all resolved.
- **Coach:** no coding-agent result calls (58 on 1 October).
- **Checks:** standings matched an independent recomputation on all 128 rows.
  Every response was `no-store`. `npm run cf:test` passed in full.
- **Bugs:** a 500 for an unknown match ID, and two Activity wording bugs.
- **Biggest frictions:**
  - the coach Results list's unlabelled score orientation;
  - a draft suggestion that could relegate a runner-up;
  - no coach view of doubles partner choices;
  - leftover disputes vanishing at season end.

Scripts, secrets, cookie jars and the local database remain only under the
ignored `.worktrees/DeuceLeague-sim-claude/.wrangler/`.

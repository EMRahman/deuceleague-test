# Start your club

You have [tried DeuceLeague](TRY.md) and want to run your club on it. A real
club is a fresh deployment without the sample, because the sample can't be
removed. Keep the trial until the real club works, then delete it.

## 1. Deploy the club

Follow [Try it, steps 1 and 2](TRY.md#1-make-two-passwords) again, with:

- **two new passwords**, not the trial's;
- a Worker name for the real club, such as `riverside-league`;
- a **new database**. Never reuse the trial's.

## 2. Create the club

1. Open `/install` and enter the new `SETUP_TOKEN`.
2. **Save the administrator key** in your password manager. It is shown once.
   It is how you sign in as the coach and manage the club, and losing it means
   the [account-owner recovery procedure](RECOVERY.md).
3. Enter your club's name, identifier and time zone.
4. Leave **Add a sample league** unticked, and create the club.

Once it's created, you can remove `SETUP_TOKEN` from the Worker's secrets to
close the installer. Setup never reopens either way.

## 3. Set up the league

The coach's site doesn't add members or seasons yet. A coding agent, such as
Claude Code, does it through the API, and shows you the changes before making
them. For example:

> Using the DeuceLeague API at https://riverside-league.your-subdomain.workers.dev,
> add the members in members.csv, then create a summer season with men's and
> women's singles in divisions of six, from last year's tables in results.pdf.

[Running the league day to day](../../docs/COACH-WORKFLOW.md) explains how to
give the agent its own key and what it can do.

Add your courts for the forecast as described in
[court forecasts](WEATHER.md).

## 4. Invite your players

Sign in at `/coach` with the administrator key. Press **Sign-in link** for each
player and send it to them, for example on WhatsApp. A link works once, within
72 hours; once signed in, a player stays signed in on that phone.

The list shows who has signed in, with those who haven't at the top, so you
know who to nudge.

## 5. When you want them

- **Your own address**, such as `league.yourclub.org`: add it as a custom
  domain in the Worker's settings, then set `PUBLIC_URL` to it in
  `wrangler.jsonc`. Players sign in again on the new address.
- **Sign-in emails**, so players can request their own links: see
  [sign-in emails](EMAIL.md).

## 6. Delete the trial

In the Cloudflare dashboard, delete the trial's Worker and its D1 database. You
can also delete the trial's repository.

## Looking after it

- **Settings** live in your repository's `wrangler.jsonc`, since a deployment
  overwrites changes made only in the dashboard. Passwords and keys stay in the
  Worker's secrets. Keep the `DB` binding's `database_id` as it is.
- **Updates:** bring new DeuceLeague versions into your repository, or ask your
  coding agent to. Each push deploys, and database changes apply before the new
  Worker is published. Check the site afterwards.
- **Your data:** D1's [Time Travel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/reference/time-travel/)
  can restore the database to an earlier point; check how far back your plan
  allows.
- **A lost administrator key:** follow the [recovery guide](RECOVERY.md). It
  needs access to your Cloudflare account.
- **Usage:** your D1 database's **Metrics** tab shows rows read and written. In
  local tests a player's home page reads about 2,700 rows, and Cloudflare's free
  plan allows 5 million a day. The free plan's 10 ms CPU limit per request has
  not been measured on Cloudflare yet: after a few days of use, check the
  Worker's **Observability** tab before deciding whether to upgrade.

For how the deployment works under the hood, see the
[deployment reference](README.md).
